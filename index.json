The classes come from the MeSH hierarchy. As new manual annotations become available, they are used to evaluate the classification performance of participating systems.\nBioASQ Task b on Biomedical Semantic QA (involves IR, QA, summarization and more) This task uses benchmark datasets containing development and test questions, in English, along with gold standard (reference) answers constructed by a team of biomedical experts. The participants have to respond with relevant concepts, articles, snippets and RDF triples, from designated resources, as well as exact and \u0026lsquo;ideal\u0026rsquo; answers.\nBioASQ Task MESINESP on Medical Semantic Indexing in Spanish In this task, the participants are asked to classify new IBECS and LILACS documents, before curators annotate them manually. The classes come from the MeSH hierarchy through the DeCS vocabulary.

Healthcare is evolving from a reactive “one-size-fits-all” system towards a system of predictive, preventive, and precision care. A personalised medicine approach is expected to lead to better health outcomes, improved treatments, and reduction in toxicity due to variable or adverse drug responses.\nThe goal of Project IASIS is to seize the opportunity provided by a wave of data heading our way and turn this into actionable information that would match the right treatment with the right type of patient. A current challenge is that there are large, heterogeneous sets of data ranging from different sources, which if combined would enable the best decisions to be made, allowing for diagnosis and treatment to be personalised to each individual. IASIS is testing this approach in two disease areas – lung cancer and Alzheimer’s disease – but with the longer-term ambition that this approach will be more widely applicable to other disease areas.\n","date":1461704400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461704400,"objectID":"dc473050f42519f45f816eb4af559260","permalink":"kbogas.github.io/project/iasis/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"kbogas.github.io/project/iasis/","section":"project","summary":"Precision medicine promises to transform the delivery of healthcare to patients.","tags":["Biomedical","Graph"],"title":"IASIS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Visit Projects Website\nREVEAL aims to advance the necessary technologies for making a higher level analysis of social media possible.
