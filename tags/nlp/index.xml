Precision medicine promises to transform the delivery of healthcare to patients. Healthcare is evolving from a reactive “one-size-fits-all” system towards a system of predictive, preventive, and precision care. A personalised medicine approach is expected to lead to better health outcomes, improved treatments, and reduction in toxicity due to variable or adverse drug responses.
The goal of Project IASIS is to seize the opportunity provided by a wave of data heading our way and turn this into actionable information that would match the right treatment with the right type of patient.</description>
