🚀 DICE at [ICAIF-2025](https://icaif25.org/)!  

We’re excited to share that **two new papers** from the team have been accepted: *Positive-Unlabeled Learning for Financial Misstatement Detection under Realistic Constraints* and *A Multimodal Alignment-Based Anomaly Detection Method for Bankruptcy Prediction*.  

Looking forward to the discussions in Singapore!
