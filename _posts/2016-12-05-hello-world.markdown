This is the first post, in this blog. _Hopefully, it also won't be the last one.._

My vision would be to post about interesting things taking up my time or thoughts on recent news, new ideas etc.
It would be great if this could become a permanent thing, but time will be the judge of this.

I am an aspiring engineer, mostly interested in machine learning and data science, but I aim to post about other things in general also.

So off we go!
